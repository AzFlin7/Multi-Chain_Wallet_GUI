atomic swap procedure:

1. Both parties create wallets on both currencies. Total of wallets: 4. 
   Since it will be done in our wallet, this step can be skiped.

2. Both parties exchange addresses.

3. Party A initializes the atomic transaction by sending X amount of cryptocurrency A'

4. A sends to B the contract # and transaction address of the past transaction.

5. Party B creates a contract "R" in A' blockchain that audits the transaction that A just  
   made. This contract needs the contract # and transaction address of the past transaction.
   Here, B can make sure that the transaction matches the agreement.

6. B now sends Y amount of B' cryptocurrency that equals the value X of A' that A sent.

7. B sends to A the contract # and transaction address of the past transaction.

8. A creates a contract "S" in B' blockchain that audits the transaction that B just  
   made. This contract needs the contract # and transaction address of the past transaction.
   Here, A can make sure that the transaction matches the agreement.

9. A now redeems the B' coins through the contract "S".

10. Party B needs to wait until party A redeems the B's he sent to extract the secret from the
    transaction made by B in point 6.
    
11. B now redeems the A' coins through the contract "R".


User experience:

1. Addresses exchange.

2. A initializes and sends contract # and tx address.

3. B "participates" and sends contract # and tx address.

3. A redeems first with the secret of his transaction.

4. Then B redeems with the secret produced by the first redeem.
